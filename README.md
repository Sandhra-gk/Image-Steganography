# Image-Steganography

Image steganography is the practice of hiding information within digital images without leaving any noticeable changes to the image. This project demonstrates the implementation of two key techniques for image steganography:

Least Significant Bit (LSB): The LSB technique involves replacing the least significant bit of each pixel in an image with a bit of the secret message. Since the change in the pixel value is minimal, the image's visual quality remains largely unaffected.

Advanced Encryption Standard (AES): AES is a widely-used symmetric encryption algorithm that ensures the confidentiality and integrity of data. 

In this project, AES is employed to encrypt the secret message before embedding it into the image.
